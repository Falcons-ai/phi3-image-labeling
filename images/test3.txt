The image depicts a surreal scene where a bird, resembling a hawk, is perched on the back of a large, dark blue whale. The whale is facing towards the left side of the image, and the bird is positioned on its dorsal fin. The bird's wings are spread wide, as if it's about to take flight. The background features a desert landscape with sand dunes, and there's a large fire burning on the left side of the image, with flames reaching up towards the sky. The sky itself is a mix of orange and blue hues, suggesting either a sunrise or sunset. The overall scene is quite fantastical and not something one would typically encounter in nature.
