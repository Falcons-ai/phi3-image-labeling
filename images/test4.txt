The diagram illustrates a process flow with a central focus on 'Eval & Curation' highlighted in a yellow oval. This central process is connected to four other elements: 'Unit Tests', 'Fine Tune w/Curated Data', 'Prompt Eng', and 'Improve Model'. Each of these elements is represented by a circle and is connected to the central process with arrows indicating the flow of the cycle. 'Unit Tests' is connected to 'Eval & Curation' with an arrow labeled 'Automate this more over time'. 'Fine Tune w/Curated Data' is connected to 'Eval & Curation' with an arrow labeled 'Versioned I Together'. 'Prompt Eng' is connected to 'Eval & Curation' with an arrow labeled 'I'. 'Improve Model' is connected to 'Eval & Curation' with an arrow labeled 'I'. Additionally, there are two rectangular boxes with dashed borders on the left and right sides of the diagram. The left box is labeled 'LLM Invocations Synthetic/Human Inputs' and the right box is labeled 'Improve Model'. There is a dashed arrow pointing from the left box to the central process and another dashed arrow pointing from the central process to the right box. The diagram is titled 'Virtuous Cycle' and has a note at the top stating 'needs to be fast'.
